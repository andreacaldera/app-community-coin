    "description": "Hello lovely friends, this Sunday I am running one of my sourdough courses here in Omega Works. Basically I will work along side you as you make your own sourdough that you will take home and bake the next morning. You will need 4 hours and a few bits and bobs, I have space for 2 more people if anybody is keen. All I ask is a donation for our bat box fund to try and savee the bats of Fish Island. If you're keen let me know.",
