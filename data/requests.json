    "description": "Would parents of children that attend Mossbourne Riverside school like to share the school run? Currently there are three children from Omega Works attending the school, with two more starting in September and more to follow. The proposal is to create a calendar of availability in order for parents to share the duties of dropping off and collecting the children from school. All interested in setting up the scheme please indicate your interest.",

    "description": "Would residents using Ocado/Tescos/Waitrose/Morrisons/Sainsburys delivery services be interested in a more efficient and carbon footprint friendly service? It is already possible to select delivery times based on other deliveries in your area, i.e. Ocado, for example, can include your order in a truck that is already designated to deliver to Omega Works if you select the same time and date for delivery. The proposal is to set up a calendar indicating most preferred times for deliveries, in order to maximise deliveries per truck so as to reduce traffic to Omega Works and better manage the flow of services. Please indicate your interest if you would like to be involved.",
